Are humans experts at processing unfamiliar faces? Some authors have recently argued "No!". We used simulations of deep neural networks and measures of human behavior to determine the sort of visual experience required to perform at human-level in the task of face verification for unfamiliar and familiar faces. Results suggest human-level performance on unfamiliar faces is impressive and requires substantial prior experience with faces. We also provide an explanation of the advantage in verifying familiar faces.
