I served as a Project TA for the NMA 2021 Computational Neuroscience course. In this role, I helped 12 groups of 2-8 students conceive of and execute projects in computational and cognitive neuroscience, using public and curated datasets. I specialized in fMRI datasets, and helped students with several projects exploring the Human Connectome Project (visual working memory, 7T retinotopy, resting state, language, network analyses, etc.), fMRI datasets with responses to a large number of natural images, a dataset that combined fMRI and MEG recordings, and multiple projects using deep neural networks as encoding models to understand visual processing.
